This folder is dedicated to the first group of tasks in the bootcamp which revolve around Data Types and Conditional Statements

Manipulation.py:
- Learnt about userinputs by getting the user to input a sentence and saving it as a variable called str_manip
- Calculated the length of this string
- Finding the first letter of the string and replacing every letter that matches this first letter with an @ sign
- Printing the last three characters of the string backgwards
- Creating a five letter word that is a combination of the first three characters and last two characters

Creating this programme taught me the basics of string manipulation and  the importance of storing user inputs as variables.

numbers.py
- Getting the user to input three different intergers
- Printing out:
-   -A sum of all these intergers
-   -The first interger minus the second interger
-   the third interger multiplied by the first interger
-   the sum of all intergers divided by the third interger

Creating this programme the taught me how versatile Python is with numeric data from user inputs. 

award.py
- Created a programme that determined the award medal for a particpant of a traithlon
- The programme will calculate the summation of the times each sport of the triathlon was completed, display this total then award the particpant based on the given instructions
- -The qualifying time is 0-100 minutes which gives the parcipant "Provincal Colours" Award
- -Completing the triathlon 5 minutes after the qualifying time (101-105 minutes) recieves "Provincal half colours" Award
- -Completing triathlon 10 minutes after the qualifying time gives particpant "Provincal scroll" award
- -All other times (i.e 111+ minutes) are given No award.

This programme taught me how Python programme calculations based on user inputs can be applied to real life scenarios while learning the basics of conditional statements.
